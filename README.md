# K-means-clustering-WineDataset
 This project demonstrates the use of K-means clustering on a wine dataset, focusing on two features: alcohol content and color intensity. It includes steps for determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method and visualizing the resulting clusters.

 Usage:
Ensure you have the wine_dataset.csv file in the project directory.
The dataset should be in CSV format with a semicolon (;) delimiter.

Run the clustering script to:

1. Load the dataset.
2. Select the alcohol and color_intensity columns.
3. Print the first few rows of the data.
4. Use the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
5. Perform K-means clustering with the chosen number of clusters.
6. Visualize the clusters and centroids.

Example Output
The script will generate the following output:

A printed preview of the first few rows of the dataset.

An Elbow method plot to help determine the optimal number of clusters.

A scatter plot visualizing the clusters and their centroids.
